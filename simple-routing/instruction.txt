  To setup and run:
---------------------------------

1. Download angular-seed to construct the scaffold:
   user% sudo git clone https://github.com/bsspirit/angular-seed.git
   user% cd angular-seed

2. Download the following files from GitHub and copy them into the folders.
   Since it is very time-consuming to download the files one by one, 
   one quick way is to download the entire Learn-AngularJS-by-Example repo.
   
   Then put each files into related subdirectory, instructed as following.
   In case there exists files in the directory, with the same names as the downloaded file, 
   replace the original file with the downloaded file.
   
   angular-seed/app/index.html
   angular-seed/app/lib/angular-ui-router.js
   angular-seed/app/lib/angular.js
   angular-seed/app/styles/bootstrap.css
   angular-seed/app/views/route1.html
   angular-seed/app/views/route1detail.html  
   angular-seed/app/views/route2.html
   angular-seed/app/views/route2detail.html  

3. Run the package.
   user% node scripts/web-server.js

4. In browser, visit http://localhost:8000/app/index.html


  Key points to understand:
---------------------------------

1. In index.html:
   <ul class="nav">
      <li><a ui-sref="state1">Route 1</a></li>
   ...
   $stateProvider
      .state('state1', {
          url: "/route1",
          templateUrl: "views/route1.html"
      })
      .state('state1.list', {
          url: "/list",
          templateUrl: "views/route1.list.html",
          controller: function($scope){
          $scope.items = ["A", "List", "Of", "Items"];
      }
   })
   
   Note, 
   
   a. ui-sref "state1" corresponds the $stateProvider's state "state1".
  
   b. url: "/route1" is the relative URL, which shown in browser like this, 
      http://localhost:8000/app/index.html#/route1


2. In views/route1.html
   <a ui-sref=".list">Show List</a>

   Note, 
   
   a. ui-sref ".list" is relative, corresponds to the $stateProvider's state "state1.list".
   b. The reason that the absolute ui-sref is "state1.list" rather than "state2.list" is that 
      views/route1.html is routed from state "state1", referring to index.html as following.
   
   $stateProvider
      .state('state1', {
          url: "/route1",
          templateUrl: "views/route1.html"
      })
      .state('state1.list', {
          url: "/list",
          templateUrl: "views/route1.list.html",
          controller: function($scope){
          $scope.items = ["A", "List", "Of", "Items"];
      }
   })
