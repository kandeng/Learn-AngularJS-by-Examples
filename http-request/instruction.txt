  To setup and run:
---------------------------------

1. Download angular-seed to construct the scaffold:
   user% sudo git clone https://github.com/bsspirit/angular-seed.git
   user% cd angular-seed

2. Download the following files from GitHub and copy them into the folders.
   Since it is very time-consuming to download the files one by one, 
   one quick way is to download the entire Learn-AngularJS-by-Example repo.
   
   Then put each files into related subdirectory, instructed as following.
   In case there exists files in the directory, with the same names as the downloaded file, 
   replace the original file with the downloaded file.
   
   angular-seed/app/index.html
   angular-seed/app/http-hello.html
   angular-seed/app/js/script.js


3. Run the package.
   user% node scripts/web-server.js

4. In browser, visit http://localhost:8000/app/index.html


  Key points to understand:
---------------------------------

1. In js/script.js:

   The usage of $http is demoed as following. 
   Notice that there are two callback functions, success() and error(). 
   
   $http({method: $scope.method, url: $scope.url, cache: $templateCache}).
      success(function (data, status) {
        $scope.status = status;
        $scope.data = data;
      }).
      error(function (data, status) {
        $scope.data = data || "Request failed";
        $scope.status = status;
      });
