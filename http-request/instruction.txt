  To setup and run:
---------------------------------

1. Download angular-seed to construct the scaffold:
   user% sudo git clone https://github.com/bsspirit/angular-seed.git
   user% cd angular-seed
   
2. Download the following files from GitHub and copy them into the folders.
   Since it is very time-consuming to download the files one by one, 
   one quick way is to download the entire Learn-AngularJS-by-Example repo,
   then put each files into related subdirectory, instructed as following.
   
   angular-seed/app/index.html
   angular-seed/app/http-hello.html
   angular-seed/app/js/script.js

3. Run the package.
   user% node scripts/web-server.js

4. In browser, visit http://localhost:8000/app/index.html



  Key points to understand:
---------------------------------

1. In js/script.js:

   Here is the usage of $http. Notice that two callback functions need to implement,
     success() and error()

   $http({method: $scope.method, url: $scope.url, cache: $templateCache}).
      success(function (data, status) {
        $scope.status = status;
        $scope.data = data;
      }).
      error(function (data, status) {
        $scope.data = data || "Request failed";
        $scope.status = status;
      });
