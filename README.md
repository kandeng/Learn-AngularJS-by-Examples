Learn AngularJS components by playing around the tutorial examples.

Here is a collection of tutorial examples for AngularJS learners. We believe the best approach to learn AngularJS is to play around the example codes and see the results. We also believe it is easier to understand each AngularJS component, by a tiny example code which emphasizes the usage of the specific component, rather than a big project which distract learner's attention with too many details. 

Each subfolder contains a tiny example, illustrating the usage of one AngularJS component.

1. Download all files in the subfolder, and keep their folder hierarchy in order. 

2. Read the "instruction.txt" file, which contains three information, 
   
   a. Setup and run,  b. Key point to understand. c. References. 

3. Read the instruction and references, at the mean time to modify the source code, and see the results.

4. Compare with the snapshot, to confirm your running result looks correct.
